In April 2009, just 3 months after inauguration, Vice-President Allard resigned from office citing ‘’irreconcilable differences’’ between himself and President Paul - likely emerging from the President’s Executive Order repealing the ‘’Don’t Ask Don’t Tell’’ policy. When former Governor of New Mexico Gary Johnson failed to be confirmed by Congress, procedure dictated that the new President of the Senate would be the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, Senator Ted Steven of Alaska.</p>
                    <p>With his failing health, discussions regarding restoring the ‘’deputy’’ President Pro Tempore position were passed around, but ultimately failed to pass before Senator Stevens’ sudden death in a car accident. This has left the position of President Pro Tempore open, and the Senate leaderless.</p>
                    <p>With no Vice-President to preside over the selection of a new President Pro Tempore, it is unclear how Congress will settle the issue. Furthermore, tradition dictates that the most senior Senator in the majority party is voted to become the President Pro Tempore - but Senators Orrin Hatch (Utah) and Richard Lugar (Indiana) both took office on January 3rd, 1977.</p>

And I certainly don’t consider the nearly $400 million spent on the policy worthwhile to the American taxpayers.

                <p>Paul sits down in the homely back office of the center, and dials the Speaker. He doesn't pick up - probably busy celebrating. Paul leaves a message, and joins the victory party. After an hour, he calls the Speaker again, and again receives no answer.</p>

This loss, following the crash, was a humiliation - but it wasn’t all his fault. The Neo-Conservatives, those bitter losers, had cost him the election. That much was clear. Had Limbaugh just accepted the will of the Republican primary, Kerry wouldn’t have his 4 more years to ruin the economy.

                <p>If there has been one thing to learn from the most recent military conflicts, it’s been that military action must be the last resort, after careful consideration to the goals of what intervention would be. What we cannot learn is that we must never get involved, as Congressman Ron Paul tried to declare in 2008. As the most powerful military force in the world, America has a duty to safeguard the basic human rights of all people in this world - and that means that there must be involvement with the Libyan civil war.</p>
                <p>Qaddafi has long rejected basic civil rights in his reign as dictator of Libya. Just weeks ago, Qaddafi ordered peaceful protestors marching to Benghazi gunned down. It was his brutal actions that sparked the armed rebellion the world now watches, and he has shown no regret for his actions. In a speech where he used the language of genocidaires, he vowed to cleanse the region of ''cockroaches (...) inch by inch, house by house, home by home, alleyway by alleyway.''</p>
                <p>We only have a rough estimate of the current kill count, but it’s ranging anywhere from 2000 to 8000 civilians killed in this shocking display of violence. This is America. We don’t sit idly by and watch dictators slaughter their own people. With the exit from Iraq being merely months old, it’s understandable why people are hesitant about NATO involvement in another region. But just because it’s understandable, doesn’t make it right.</p>
                <p>According to some dubiously reliable leaks, President Kerry is receiving advice to either create a no-fly zone over Libya, or intervene directly, and allegedly leans towards the latter. That a no-fly zone is even being considered is farcical - that won’t do anything to stop Qaddafi’s tanks or chemical weapons. We can only pray that President Kerry intervenes - to protect the civilians at risk, and ensure that democracy can rise from the ashes of the Qaddafi regime.</p>
