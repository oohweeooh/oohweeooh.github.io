            <p>There were some early cheers and boos as the safest of safe areas were called, but after Oklahoma was called, they never booed again. The midwest was painted a solid blue, while the South saw states people thought would never flip Democrat after Clinton returned to their roots. Call it Ron Paul’s radicalism, call it Limbaugh’s vote stealing, Kerry didn’t care. He had won. In the face of a failed first term and an economic disaster not seen since the 30s, Kerry had been found worthy to continue his mission.</p>
            <p>The Senate was surely flipped to his favor, and the House would no doubt find itself more purple. A real national renewal could begin, even if Kerry didn’t have much time to try and pull it off. Medicare expansion, green energy, social justice - he had his work cut out for him. He smiled as he stepped to the podium to deliver his victory speech, the future looking brighter than he had ever seen.</p>

It was four years late to the party, but the Senate could finally be more friendly to his agenda. Of course, even if it was outright blue, he had his work ahead of him. A Republican House and enough Republicans to filibuster meant he couldn’t be a truly transformative figure, and actually outright winning the Senate was unlikely.</p>

            <p>As the last NATO troops leave Iraq, and the White House seems eager to put the quagmire behind us, one is inexorably reminded of the former President George W. Bush's speech in 2003 declaring ‘’the end of major combat operations in Iraq’’, and a ‘mission accomplished’’. We know, with hindsight, that the declaration was foolhardy, and came too early, which leads us to ask - can we be sure that President Kerry’s similar declaration, assuring Americans that ‘’we are ready, now, to put this war behind us’’ isn’t of the exact same vein?</p>
            <p>For starters, combat deaths have reached an absolute minimum, for both Iraqi and American combatants - only 7 Americans were KIA in 2009, contrasted with 31 insurgent deaths. This is credited to a significant decrease in insurgent capabilities and in hostile sentiment between Americans and Iraqis. The Iraqi Ground Forces have, in recent months, proven more than able to keep order in the countryside and defeat what insurgent forces remain.</p>
            <p>But a lasting peace needs more than military victory - it needs political stability as well, which the government of President Talabani and Prime Minister Allawi will have to demonstrate in the coming months and years if Iraq is to truly thrive.</p>

Kerry sighed. Another 4 years of failure, or 4 years of using Bush’s tools and empowering a backlash. He shook his head, and dispelled these thoughts. Kerry exited the backrooms and went to take the stage.</p>

The proposals, first made by Chair of the Judiciary Committee Lamar Alexander (R-TX), have earned voracious approval from John Conyer (D-MI) and Jim Clyburn (D-SC). In the Senate, the old alliance between Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-WI) may be reignited with both men enthusiastically supporting the proposed change from the House.</p>
          <p>In the White House, the President’s stance is unknown. Being the only President to have won the election without the popular vote twice, the President is expected to oppose the proposed amendment. However, at a press conference, Press Secretary Stephanie Cutter merely stated ''The President has limited involvement in constitutional amendments.'' When asked directly if the White House supports the Amendment, Cutter bluntly remarked ''That’s entirely irrelevant.''</p>
          <p>Some have taken this as the President disapproving of the measure, but political analyst Charlie Cook argues differently. ''President Kerry can’t come out and support the amendment. That would be paramount to saying ''look, I shouldn’t be president and I know it.'' He faces enough heat from Republicans already, he shouldn’t throw logs into the fire. The fact that he’s not defending the electoral college, talking about unions and sovereignty and such, indicates that he leans a certain way. It’s just a politically untenable position. With how long it takes for an Amendment to pass, I think you’ll live to see former President Kerry come out in favour of it.''</p>

        <p>One year after American forces pulled out from Iraq, restrictive policies enforced by the unrecognized government of ISIS have drastically restricted basic rights, and brought their daily lives to a halt. One woman, speaking to MSNBC on condition of strict anonymity, described their plight. ''This is a man’s country. Women do not have good opportunities anymore. Before, I was able to live without my hijab. Now, were I to do that, men would come and beat my brother until he forced me to wear one.''</p>
        <p>This backslide in civil rights has been exacerbated by Supreme Leader al-Baghdadi’s declaration that public stoning for crimes like adultery will return, defiantly saying ''You say it’s a violation of women’s rights when we stone them to death (...) but we will soon implement it as a punishment for adultery. Women will be stoned publicly. Women will be flogged publicly.'' Prime David Cameron of Britain described the restoration of these 90s era punishment as ''one of the most morally abhorrent and heartbreaking backslides in civil rights in the last century'' while Chancellor Merkel has called on the European Union to unite against the ''backwards and evil theocracy.''</p>
        <p>The White House has issued no statement - Press Secretary Rachel Mills has described the backsliding as unfortunate, but irrelevant to America and its interests. The president himself has offered ''thoughts and prayers''' and seems to believe that will be satisfactory enough to women America has abandoned with its pullout.</p>
        <p>The thoughts and prayers will need to help the women of Iraq, who have watched any hope for a brighter future be snatched away with the messy pull-out. Fortunately for these women, Senator Obama has been working with Senator Biden to draft legislation to try and help women escape Iraq to America - but with the Senate majority in the hands of the Republicans, who knows the future of the refugee bill.</p>

Updates as they come.</p>
        <p>Update: the White House has published his new demands. The full memo has been posted on social media, but key parts are: a 40% reduction in Social Security spending, a 60% reduction in SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) spending, and a total end to President Bush's key African initiative, PEPFAR.</p>
