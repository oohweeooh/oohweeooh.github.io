Outside of the pool, there were 11 million Muscovites clamoring amongst each other. Outside of the pool, there was the weight of his duties as prime minister of the largest country on the planet, the weight of being one of the most powerful men in the world. Outside of the pool, far from Moscow, there was a war going on.</p><p>Inside the pool, there was only the water and Putin. He loved swimming, absolutely adored it in a way that he adored little else. Physically, it gave him a chance to test the mettle of his 56-year-old body, to force it to collaborate with him. Mentally, it gave him a chance to shut out the outside voices, to focus solely upon his own thoughts. It was the latter half of the equation that was more important at the moment, as he needed all of the mental firepower possible to answer the biggest riddle there was: America.</p><p>At the moment, he was about halfway through untying the Gordian knot, but he could not, for the life of him, wrap his head around figuring out how America had succeeded as much as it had when its residents were so uniformly fucking stupid. On American election night, he had gone to bed at the normal time, expecting that he’d wake up knowing what the country’s fate would be. Then, the next day, he had found out just how stupid the American system was. The election had deadlocked? There was going to be a contingent election? Or maybe there actually wasn’t? Nobody was quite sure? Nobody knew who was going to win? He had a set of apparatchiks come into his office, brilliant young men and women who had relentlessly studied America their whole lives to the point of even travelling in it extensively, to explain what exactly had gripped the American political system. None of them could explain it.</p><p>Putin felt that nobody quite exemplified the concept of American stupidity quite like President Clark, the general. Putin had read the briefings: objectively speaking, the man was a genius, and more than that, a competent genius who could lead with authority. A man that smart, that capable, should have been able to have the great levels of the world’s superpower turned to suit his will in no time at all. Instead, here he was, engaged in petty squabbles with a Republican party who, if Putin was being honest, seemed like a gang of corrupt goons. Now, in the face of a national crisis, rather than handling it like the man who had brought down Milosevic, he instead was having a meltdown, getting emotional on live television, ranting like a lunatic. It was unfitting. The only reason for a man that great to have been brought down had to be the eternal stupidity of the American nation. It was the only explanation that made sense.</p>`)

William Fallon (Ret.)</b></p><p>When the president assembled a conclave of the brightest military minds to help him in his crusade against Iran, the man once dubbed "The Boss of the Middle East" stormed out like a burning building, and now, in a similar fashion, he sits with us to tell the tale.</p><p>Admiral William Fallon, the four-star general who once oversaw the U.S. Central Command, never took glee from entering the spotlight. But now, after his abrupt resignation in February, just weeks into the McCain administration, he's breaking his silence. "The next catastrophe the American people deserve to know about ahead of time."</p><p><b>THE WAR THAT ALMOST WAS</b></p><p>When John McCain took the oath of office in January, the transition from campaign rhetoric to Oval Office restraint was swift and jarring. While the economy continued its derailment from the tracks, instead of dealing with the immediate problem, he turned his interest toward one topic in classified meetings: Iran.</p><p>"They were like zombies," Fallon says, straight-faced. "Not in a strategic way, but driven by some morale crusade. Iran wasn't just a problem; it was a dragon to be slain."</p><p>Fallon, a seasoned naval officer with decades of experience and rooms filled with vouchers ready to stand up beside him, explained it was as if it were a movie. "The intel was bare bones. The scenarios were worst-case by default. The confidence was astounding, and for what? Because they were weak? They were anything but weak.</p><p>Fallon claimed he made string assertions that were cast aside. He laid out facts, plans, fallout estimates, and a lack of exit strategies. "It was as if I shouted at a wake. The room would quiet until the Vice President said, 'The window is closing.' That's when I realized they were too far gone.</p><p><b>THE FINAL STRAW</b></p><p>The breaking point came during a January 30th meeting in the Situation Room. "We had barely gotten our foot in the door, and they piled papers on our feet. A package of coordinated strikes. This was planned long before the president had announced his intention to run.</p><p>By February 5, Fallon had his foot halfway out the door. The public excuse was "philosophical differences." Behind closed doors, it was apparent.</p><p>"I told them, 'You're going to destabilize the region over a fantasy told by video games. You want a seasoned resume to bless it? Not happening."</p><p>"I told them, 'You're going to blow up the region over a fantasy. And you want my uniform to bless it? Not happening.'"</p><p><b>THE GENERAL VS. THE HAWK</b></p><p>McCain was no stranger to saber-rattling; after all, he outhawked nearly every opponent he faced during his presidential campaign. He started with his infamous "bomb, bomb, bomb Iran" joke, which got the right people in New Hampshire to sink their neighboring state's golden child in favor of a brave confrontational ideology. Then, he shouted about the threat of a new Axis Powers while against Clark.</p><p>While teenagers in the Oval Office chatted about raining hellfire over millions of civilians like it was high school gossip, Fallon stood as the adult in the room.</p><p>"They weren't looking for a strategy, or a plan, they wanted validation." </p><br><b>Related Stories:</b><br><span style="color:blue;"><u>McCain’s Cabinet: Bush era déjà vu?</span></u><br><span style="color:blue;"><u>Is the former president planning on joining CODE PINK protests?</span></u><br><span style="color:blue;"><u>The Party of War Returns: Is diplomacy dead?</p>`)

<p><b>Opinion:</b> <u>President John McCain rode into the White House on the economic woes of the Clark Administration.

Democrats nationwide ran on four words: "He Killed Social Security." The McCain administration knew this insurmountable task was unpopular, and his trips throughout the states to make the bill to reform the system seem popular only hurt its public view. McCain's refusal to cut taxes as a compromise for the bill eliminated all and any support from the opposition. However, what hurt him most was the collapse of the support within the Republican base. The old folk who relied on Social Security felt uncomfortable with his reforms. Regardless, by the summer of 09, he didn't seem to waver in supporting such a plan.</p><p>Public opinion hit a boiling point, but McCain still had the numbers to get what he wanted to be passed. So he ignored the normality of representing the people and forced upon America a "tough pill to swallow." Democrats tried to pull any tricks they could to combat the bill, but they lacked the numbers to stop it, and Republicans sent the bill through. Well, now, here we are. The American people have rejected the McCain administration's pill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has the numbers to comfortably stalemate whatever McCain may bring from here.

<p><b>Phoenix (Reuters) - </b> Republican John McCain lost Tuesday's presidential election in an upset at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The veteran Senator, whose poll numbers had surged to astronomical numbers in September, came crashing down by election day.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts on all sides of the aisle were scratching their heads. How could this happen? President Clark had completely crashed his campaign by attacking Senator McCain's service.</p><p>Clark's apology for such remarks was equally unpopular and most pathetic. The President's approval rating with veterans had dropped to dangerously low levels.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Senator's hopes and dreams faded on election night.</p><p>Eight years after his original presidential campaign in 2000, Senator McCain often came off as a polished statesman with a respectable record.</p><p>But the surprise outcome isn't one without some reasoning. The Senator's selection of Democrat Joe Lieberman had stirred much criticism from his right flank, culminating in the surge of the Reform Party nominee Pat Buchanan.</p><p>In a solemn concession speech, Senator McCain reflected on his own mistakes and offered nothing but goodwill to the President.</p><p>"This was a difficult campaign but I'm proud of our enthusiastic support," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Phoenix. "Now it's time for our nation to heal and I hope all the best for our nation and President Clark."</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said McCain's choice for Vice President had been the most obvious source to blame for the defeat.</p><p>"Senator McCain was often cautioned that a move of picking a running mate from the opposite party would come to this."</p><p>The financial crisis that erupted in September, followed by President Clark's remarks on Face The Nation, had seemingly given McCain an untouchable lead. Gallup polls in late September showed the Senator 15 points ahead of Clark.</p><p><b>OVERCONFIDENCE, BAD OPTICS</b></p><p>It's unavoidable that at least some reason McCain lost comes down simply to Joe Lieberman's selection. A pro-choice Democrat with a strong gay rights record was too much for the Republican base to consider.</p><p>He championed national security concerns and a return to a respectable foreign policy but often neglected the bread and butter issues like abortion. Lieberman only helped double down on these issues, limiting the campaign's range.</p><p>The financial crisis also put conservatism as an ideology under much speculation. While President Clark responded calmly and firmly, Senator McCain's proposals didn't go far enough. The offer of tax cuts and reigning in government spending during a crisis and calamity had fallen flat.</p><p>Aides of the Clark Administration seem equally bewildered by the outcome.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that anyone will ever have an easier and more advantaged political climate than Senator McCain was given." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top McCain campaign officials say that the outcome also blindsided McCain.</p><p>What about Lieberman? To most, McCain's pick for Vice President did nothing to sew ties with the right flank and potentially tanked the veteran Senator's campaign.</p><p>High-profile Republicans such as former Senator Rick Santorum rejected McCain partially because of Lieberman.</p><p>"McCain spent the entire summer drawing a contrast between his conservativism and Clark's liberalism and Lieberman through all that through the window," said Republican strategist Scott Reed. "(But) you can't blame Lieberman for the loss. He reigned in the moderate Democrats..."”</p><p>McCain senior adviser Nicolle Wallace said the Arizona senator got a rough deal electorally from Buchanan, who "sabotaged" the Republican ticket. As a result, President Clark was able to revive a long-dead electoral coalition in the South held together by ancestral Democrats, sometimes winning states while barely holding 40% of the vote share.</p><p>"No objective analysis suggests that the Clark campaign wasn't directly helped by Buchanan. It's fair to assume Democrats did their fair share of spreading the word of Buchanan's candidacy."

Reid looks at the President and inquires into his positivity in the project to reinvent the American Healthcare system. McConnell looks more glum than usual, selecting instead to stare in idly at the carpeted floors of this chosen room away from prying eyes.

His next steps were going to be covered thoroughly, so he’d have to tread carefully.</b></p><p>Months of cajoling, talks across the aisle and a little bit of watering down to bring some Republicans across, the American Healthcare Reform Act was signed into law by President Romney to the relative chagrin of many Republicans he pleaded with to support the law. With re-election around the corner there is muted praise from the democratic candidates and even former Vice President Crist, who since departing early this year has started what some called a hopeless campaign for the Democratic Party’s nomination just one week prior to the signing.</p><p>While the last three years have indeed been confusing politically, Romney’s rather sturdy sense of pride in the bill is evident as he recalled at the signing it was not ‘100% what everyone in this roomed wanted but it will 100% help many Americans, and I cannot think of a more noble and righteous goal in this office I have been bestowed.’</p><p>The question still lays on if the President’s bold bipartisan move will help or hurt him in the national theatre of political discourse but it is perhaps fitting to say this will without a shadow of a doubt be the most historically significant moment of his first term, perhaps with the exception of the success of Operation Neptune Spear this past spring. President Romney has absconded from Republican thinking of healthcare, will the party absconded from him next November and will he lose happily with a cleared conscience?</p>`)

"They were so gentle suggesting I deport myself, they went through all my belongings hurrying me along and my house was torn apart but they assured me this was the most humane possible way to do it."</p><p>Motivated by Romney's immigration policy and ICE agents banging down his door, Enrique sold his truck, quit his landscaping job, and began walking toward Mexico. "I didn't even know which way was south," he admits. "I used the stars, the scent of cilantro, and an outdated Taco Bell receipt with a map on the back."</b></p><p>Romney's presidency now hailed as a success story for the National Etiquette Restoration Act, was marked by sweeping reforms, including the Voluntary Exodus Encouragement Act, which replaced all immigration forms with a mirror and a post-it note reading, "You know what to do."</p><p>Critics like Governor Rick Perry, who conducts more forceful immigration reform in Texas, like the establishment of Texans "own Guantanamo" on a floating island built by immigrants. Romney responded to the attacks, stating, "Look, if people want to stay in America, they'll stay. But they'll go if they don't want to be hassled by federal agents disguised as Pizza Hut delivery drivers. That's the free market of residence."</p><pEnrique’s journey was no easy task. "I was halfway through Arizona when I realized I forgot my passport. But I remembered Mitt said, 'When life gives you immigration status, give it back like a gentleman.' So I kept walking."</p><p>Enrique rebuilt his life in Sonora as a freelance sombrero consultant and occasionally appears back in America for TED Talks, giving motivational speeches about leaving the country.</p><p>No matter the struggle, Enrique holds no ill will toward the President. "Romney taught me something. If you don't belong somewhere, you should definitely leave quietly and let the economy figure it out. That's the American way."</p><p>When confronted, President Romney nodded and said, "Good. The system works."</p>`)

<p><b>Miami (Reuters) - </b>- Republican Jeb Bush lost Tuesday's presidential election in an upset at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The now 3rd member of the Bush Clan to grasp the Republican Nomination for President failed to make his case to the voters.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts on all sides of the aisle were blown away. How could this happen? With the financial crisis and Iraq in turmoil, this election seemed like a shoe victory to most.</p><p>Clark's actions left him entirely exposed to easy attacks from the right. Neoconservative icons were crawling out of the woodwork it lambast his foreign policy.</p><p>But despite all these factors, including a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the former Governor met the same fate his brother did four years prior and his father faced in 1992.</p><p>Just 4 years ago, President George W. Bush's political career ended with General Clark in what many also called a shocking upset. At the time, it was unthinkable that the man who oversaw the events of 9/11, sporting a once untouchable approval rating, could fall flat in spectacular fashion.</p><p>Now, with his brother meeting a similar fate in what should have been even easier circumstances, most are asking if the Bush name is a curse or if Wesley Clark is untouchable.</p><p>In a bewildered concession speech, the former Governor congratulated the President and spoke of the need to unite behind the President during this crisis.</p><p>"These results may not be what we all wanted, but that doesn't take away from the issues we brought attention to during this campaign," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Miami. "I hope President Clark takes note of this and pray that he can lead our nation into a greater future during his second term."</p><pRepublican strategist John Feehery was equally baffled by the results, struggling to understand why he alluded to a gap between Bush and the Republican base.</p><p>"Governor Bush struggled to connect with key voting demographics below college educated voters. Possibly his immigration and education stances being liberally prone like his primary opponents often highlighted."</p><p>The primary opponent Feehery is referring to was Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who often attacked Bush for his weak stance on immigration and suggested many dedicated Republicans could be turned off by it.</p><p><b>OUT OF TOUCH, EASILY EXPOSED</b></p><p>It's hard not to blame the range of different avenues Democrats could attack Bush from, whether it was his handling of the Schiavo Case, unpopular social issues stances, or even the controversy surrounding the 2000 Florida recounts brought up.</p><p>He first championed his foreign policy, attacking President Clark's handling of the war in Iraq. While media think tanks often agreed with Bush, exit polls display Iraq as either the 3rd or 4th most important issue of the election.</p><p>The financial crisis had put economic solutions at the forefront of people's concerns. While President Clark responded calmly and firmly, Governor Bush's proposals often didn't go far enough for voters. The offer of tax cuts and reigning in government spending during a crisis and calamity had fallen flat.</p><p>Aides of the Clark Administration seem equally bewildered by the outcome.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that anyone will ever have an easier and more advantaged political climate than Governor Bush was given." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Bush campaign officials say that the outcome was of huge disappointment and surprise to Jeb.</p><p>What about Ridge? To most, the selection of the former Pennsylvania Governor and Homeland Security Secretary did little to help sew toes with Bush's right flank, and in return, it brought about the underlying distrust of the George W. Bush Administration. As Secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge oversaw an era of massive oversight and human rights violations.</p><p>While the pick didn't damage Bush's relationship with Republicans, it didn't do much to excite them.</p><p>"Bush had promised to deliver on key Republican issues during the primaries but chose to run to the center once nominated," said Republican strategist David Kochul. "Ridge isn't to blame for the loss this was of Bush's doing and him alone."</p><p>Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz said Bush ran a stellar campaign, but President Clark had nailed him on minor issues. As a result, President Clark could trade votes he lost in states struck by the recession for votes in traditionally Democratic states.</p><p>"Nothing in the exit polls tell us Governor Bush was simply unpopular by name recognition, there's more to the story and I'd like people to understand these things are complicated," he said.</p><p>Editing by Alan Elsner</p><p>Our Standards: <br>The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</br></p>`)

<p><b>New York City (Reuters) - </b> Republican Rudy Giuliani lost Tuesday's presidential election in a humiliating defeat at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The celebrity Mayor, whose fame in politics could only be rivaled by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, was expected to take the polls by storm but came up short.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts said his many weaknesses were exposed little by little. The firefighter revolting, his affairs, his ties to Bernard Kerik—it all came crashing down on him. President Clark dutifully exploited this and made the election more about Rudy's blemishes than the disaster he brewed in Iraq, not to mention the collapsing economy.</p><p>Giuliani's attempts to portray President Clark as a tax-raising socialist who let terrorists take over Iraq grew stale with moderates, and whatever gains he made with them, he lost double the evangelicals in the South.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President with a sputtering economy and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Mayor lost by the fundamentals in running a campaign.</p><p>After 7 years of preparing his political ascendancy to the presidency, Giuliani entered with a monumental lead and was ready to take on the issues of the working class.</p><p>But the Mayor failed to respond to the crisis with effective language, at times sounding callous and heartless and sometimes aloof to the troubles facing everyday Americans. Party strategists point to Giuliani's incoherent economic messaging, which ranged from conservative to the same "Nanny" approach he often criticized.</p><p>In a difficult-to-hear concession speech late Tuesday, the former Mayor reflected on the campaign and seemingly struggled to accept blame for his failure.</p><p>"When I think back to everything I accomplished this campaign, I'm proud of the work I've done for you," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in New York. We fought hard for those who felt abandoned by Democrats and for the people we lost on 9/11."</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said Giuliani's deep ties to the Bush administration might have ended up becoming a net negative with sore wounds prevailing from Iraq.</p><p>"He was always seen next to Bush advisors like Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld. People who were well known to the general public as war propeteers."</p><p>The financial crisis that erupted in September had seemingly solidified Giuliani's victory to most, but in early October, evidence of him paying off a mistress with city funds resurfaced, blowing through much of the Mayor's lead.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, MASSIVE GAFFES</b></p><p>Giuliani deeply wounded himself after refusing to answer a question about whether or not he'd pardon his former associate Bernard Kerik if elected president. Among other gaffes, he often became his own worst enemy.</p><p>He championed himself as someone above it all while being in touch with people's needs. This backfired on many of his proposals, and Giuliani often came off as elitist and running on vanity.</p><p>The financial crisis also put Giuliani's "conservativism" under speculation. While President Clark came off as calm and strong in his response, the Mayor appeared aloof to what Americans needed. This was especially so when he got into a public feud with Senator Hillary Clinton over her broad economic plan, including freezing foreclosures nationwide.</p><p>Aides say Giuliani's response to the economic crisis muddied the debate and gave President Clark an opening.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that anyone will ever have an easier and more advantaged political climate than Mayor Giuliani was given." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Giuliani aids say the Mayor is deeply bitter about his former campaign allies, like Senator Sam Brownback, calling on him to drop out of the race in favor of his running mate, Representative Mike Pence of Indiana.</p><p>What about Pence?

<p><b>By Juliana Malini</b></p><p>11:23 PM March 13th</p><p>Newly inaugurated President <b>Ron Paul</b> staked opposition to future government interference in the ongoing recession well before his climactic victory against then-President <b>Wesley Clark</b>. Clark, who oversaw the beginning of the global recession that many economists argue started near the end of 2007, ran on a platform of rapid government response to the crisis. Paul, by contrast, spearheaded the End The Fed movement, which sought to close the Federal Reserve and end all federal government meddling in fiscal affairs.</p><p>After a spirited campaign against the establishment in the Republican primaries, Paul benefited from high independent support and even crossover support with liberal Democrats frustrated by Clark's foreign policy. Clark became the face of rage against the establishment, corporate meddling, and dishonest foreign policy focus. Soon after, Paul would be declared the race's victor once the votes were cast, solidifying an anti-establishment revolution.</p><p>Staying true to his word, President Paul quickly reined in both the Treasury and Reserve's moves to combat the recession. When word of Bank Of America's hardship hit the Oval Office, Paul valiantly declared, "Not a dime of the American taxpayer's money will go into the hands of a banker who failed his job." The Dow Jones Industrial Index plummeted 4% points just at the news of his announcement and would drop another 5% once Bank Of America collapsed. Repeating much of the sorrow impacting financial markets in the wake of Lehman's Brothers failure, stock markets nationwide plummeted.<p>President Paul sits jovial at the desk of American leadership, smiling with pride, believing it's all a market correction. Only a few months into his presidency, his approval rating sits at a historic low of 29% against 58% disapprove. Something he seems quite proud of as if he's to be a Jesus-like figure who will be vindicated by time.</p><p>The Republican establishment, particularly in the Senate, is still fighting in Michigan courtrooms to seat Representative <b>Justin Amash</b>, who beat Senator <b>Sanders Levin</b> by a historically close margin of less than 200 votes. Levin was appointed to finish the term of his brother <b>Carl Levin</b>, who was nominated Secretary of Defense by <b>Wesley Clark</b> after he was inaugurated.

His record was electoral poison, especially when his stance on Social Security was brought to the forefront, scaring the Republican base of the 65-and-older crowd. Furthermore, he alienated the traditional Republican farm states with his outspoken criticism of farm subsidies.</p><p>In a tough-pill-to-swallow concession speech, the Representative noted the massive achievement this election was for the libertarian movement.</p><p>"We may have lost, but the ideas brought forth prove that the libertarian experiment can be accomplished," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Dallas.

<p><b>Kansas City (Reuters) - </b>—Republican Sam Brownback lost Tuesday's presidential election at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The establishment Senator turned Tea Party preacher sought the full erratic support of the Republican base to bring a more traditionalist view to the American Government.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts pointed to one aspect of his campaign: hate. Sam Brownback campaigned on the rage of evangelical Christians, hoping to turn out a large and capable coalition, but his many weaknesses disturbed the moderates within the party. President Clark, by contrast, campaigned to stop hate of all forms, garnering his dedicated following as a result.</p><p>While Brownback's coalition was loyal and dedicated, he lacked support among key groups, especially those most concerned with foreign policy.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Senator failed to convince voters on fundamental issues.</p><p>Brownback's entry into politics was profoundly unrecognizable compared to the way he conducted this campaign. Once an advocate for bipartisanship, Brownback seemingly dropped all compromise within his heart after Clark pushed the Freedom To Marry Act.</p><p>The failure to compromise became Brownback's downfall as his full embrace of populist themes quickly eroded through the patience of establishment Republicans. Radical tax positions, even for a Republican, combined with his extreme views on abortion and dovish foreign policy, limited the range of his coalition.</p><p>In his concession speech, which was followed by a prayer, the Senator noted the massive, glorious movement that enveloped his campaign.</p><p>"I know this loss hangs heavy in our hearts but believe me when I say, we've accomplished more for our Christian faith during this campaign than anyone could have ever imagined." he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Kansas City. "I still dream of a day where our deeply religious population aren't held captive by activist governments and that dream is still within reach, we must keep fighting for our children, for our grandchildren and for Christ!"</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said Brownback's deeply religious campaign reawakened a populist element within the Republican Party.</p><p>"The crowds he generated weren't just excited, they were frothing for change and praying in unison with him."</p><p>The financial crisis only encouraged the Senator to redouble his efforts on populist talking points like his great tax experiment and massive deregulations.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, TOO RADICAL</b></p><p>Brownback was committed to the idea that the separation between church and state had to be abolished, so much so that he mentioned his Christian faith in every facet of the campaign, from foreign policy to economics.</p><p>He championed himself as a Christian first and a senator second, which quickly gave his campaign a unique and colorful image.</p><p>The financial crisis had blown through President Clark's lead, and most believed Brownback could make a comeback in the same spirit as Bill Clinton in 1992. However, through laser-focused determination and inspiring leadership, President Clark was able to repel Brownback's gains and lead the nation through the crisis convincingly.</p><p>Aides said Brownback's plan for the government cuts, while appealing to a significant portion of his base, worried fiscal hawks, who were unsure how the United States could pay for such extreme tax cuts.</p><p>"It is a great sigh of relief that Senator Brownback's hateful campaign was rejected." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Brownback aides say the Senator is jubilant, seemingly believing his strategy was vindicated for coming as close as it did.</p><p>What about Bachmann? To most, Brownback's choice for running mate was initially brave and inspirational but soon became an utter nightmare when her radical tendencies came to the forefront, especially her strange beliefs on bullying and even more dangerous ideas of gutting social security.</p><p>Brownback's campaign manager, Rob Wasinger, defended the campaign's radical stances, claiming they were not out of step with standard Republican ideology.</p><p>"The Republican Party was behind this campaign 100% and we need to acknowledge how close we came to victory," Wasinger told reporters at the Brownback campaign headquarters in Kansas City.

<p>By Jessica Frowigs</p><p>With the 2010 midterm elections looming over Brownback's mandate like a storm, local Iowan petitioners and protesters are demanding Senator Grassley to roll back the "Great American Tax Experiment," which has made its impact on both the minds and wallets of thousands of Iowans statewide. The bill, which made landfall in late 2009 amid an already limping economy wounded from the great recession, has all but helped the Middle and lower classes. </p><p>The Great American Tax Experiment was passed through Congress with the promise of encouraging job growth with radical tax cuts on the super wealthy. Instead, the United States underwent a historic downgrade of its credit rating after budget shortfalls and negotiations over the debt ceiling stalled and left the world holding its breath. Since then, the Democratic Party has seized the narrative, nationalizing local races from top to bottom, with the culmination of Republican worries manifesting under the heel of Senator Chuck Grassley's reelection bid.</p><p>After touring through the state hearing out the woes of everyday Iowans, former Governor Tom Vilsack threw his hat into the ring to challenge Grassley, believing the entrenched Senator had lost his touch with Iowa folk. Collecting a coalition of aching teamster representatives, working families unable to afford their groceries, and farmers denied access to Healthcare after Medicaid and Medicare cuts sliced through the national budget, Vilsack currently polls just behind Grassley, stepping on his heels. </p><p>The movement to repudiate the Brownback agenda isn't just a Democratic play for power; moderate Republicans in swing districts have begun to draw up their amendment to the bill, hoping to pull back the political tiger clawing at their reelection efforts. Income taxes would go up, and millions of homeowners nationwide would pay taxes again to avoid any more budget shortfalls shortly, but for Democrats, it isn't a compromise; they want to tear Brownback apart. Facing scorn from all sectors of the political arena for the cuts made to the welfare state, leaving those in need helpless.</p><p>Grassley finds himself not just in a fight to defend himself but also in a battle to protect the incumbent president whom he has stood by thus far. A reelection bid hoping that nice words and smiles can make Iowa's Middle and lower class forget that it was the Republican Party that took their access to healthcare away, it was President Brownback who gutted the federal government's ability to upkeep hospitals and roads. It was Senator Chuck Grassley who voted to annihilate the national budget in favor of making the rich richer while allowing those without a comfortable yacht to sleep in to find themselves pulled down by an economic riptide.</p>`)

<p><b>Houston (Reuters) - </b>Republican Dick Cheney lost Tuesday's presidential election burdened by chaos at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The former Vice President, who had a habit of making a villain out of those who opposed them, fell short of the widely expected routing of Wesley Clark.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts came to a multitude of conclusions. The controversial convention nomination, Huckabee supporters staying home, an uncharismatic campaign, and his unpopularity were all floated possibilities. President Clark dutifully exploited this and made the election a referendum on the decisions made by the "Cheney White House" 4 years prior.</p><p>Cheney's attempts to portray Clark as a failure in foreign affairs failed to turn heads meaningfully. He often found himself the lone voice shouting to the heavens.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Vice President collapsed under the weight of his own failings.</p><p>If you had asked anyone at George W. Bush's 2004 election night rally if Republicans would nominate his unpopular number 2, most would have laughed in your face.</p><p>What Cheney failed to provide was a popular agenda to justify why he had to rip the nomination from Huckabee's hands essentially. Running on a platform of vindication would only carry him so far and proved not to get the voters out into booths for him.</p><p>In a cold concession speech, the Vice President reflected on his campaign accepting fault, but like many who voted against him, the crowd felt his apology was disingenuous.</p><p>"Clearly, the American people have made their decision, and the numbers aren't in our favor," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Houston. I'm sorry that they failed to understand the gravity of what is at stake, and I pray that the president understands the mandate given to him." </p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said that when presented with the actions of the Bush administration, the American people rebuked them.</p><p>"The general public is not willing to go back to what they already voted against once. Hoping for Bush to be vindicated was a losing strategy for Republicans."</p><p>The financial crisis that erupted in September had given Republicans confidence that even if Cheney had not earned the nomination fairly, he would be elected via Clark's sheer incompetence.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, WRONG CANDIDATE </b></p><p>Polls after the convention projected that if Governor Mike Huckabee had won the nomination, he'd have led Clark by a comfortable margin. Other polls for candidates such as Senator John McCain and Governor Mitt Romney concluded a similar outcome. </p><p>Governor Huckabee, who went into the Republican National Convention, was widely expected to be the party's nominee until party insiders worked to find a better consensus candidate. After four ballots, Cheney became their pick.</p><p>The financial crisis also put Cheney's government experience under speculation. While President Clark came off as calm and firm in his response, the Vice President came off as cold and uncaring for families hurting from the crisis.</p><p>Clark's aides claim that Cheney was doomed to lose from the beginning and that the circumstances he squandered were enormous.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that anyone will ever have an easier and more advantaged political climate than Dick Cheney was given." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Cheney aides claim that the Huckabee camp is to blame for not helping the Republican ticket get across the finish line.</p><p>What about Snowe? To most, Cheney's pick for Vice President failed to bring out enough independents to make her selection worthwhile and alienated Huckabee supporters who hoped to be thrown a bone. </p><p>Cheney Senior Advisor John Bolten concluded that Republican Party extremists dropped the ball.</p><p>"The Republican Party needs to back away from extremist elements within the party and put forward responsible and feasible platforms," Bolten told reporters at the Cheney campaign headquarters in Houston.

It's good to have you here, Rahm.</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Thanks, Anderson. Good to be with you.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>So, the dust has settled, and I think we have had enough time to analyze what went wrong last year, but I'd love to know where you think the Democrats failed. Why did Clark lose?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Look, Anderson, elections are about contrast and confidence. Voters faced two major conflicts, one at home and the other abroad. Clark ran an administration filled with ambition, passing bold ideas without caring about the political ramifications of such legislation. Labels mean a lot in this business, and the President getting stuck with the word "radical" on his forehead hurt the team. That scared a lot of voters in the middle.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Clark often justified his momentum based strategy by arguing that the base would be hardened and remain committed to the Democrats as long as things were getting done. Why do you think that failed?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>It's pretty simple. People like consistency; they want to feel secure. Clark often attacked the system that elected him and thus was rejected because people felt scared. He had a legislative freight train built, and instead of saying "all aboard," he tied parts of the Democratic coalition on the railroad and ran right over them. It came off as ideological overreach rather than pragmatic leadership.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Wasn't Clark trying to seize a moment of transformation after the Bush years?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Of course, he was, and that's a noble mission, but transforming the system doesn't mean you need to burn it to the ground. The President needs to work through the system, build trust, and build alliances. Clark was a general; he led troops and the country, but politics required more chess and less blitzkrieg.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Some argue that the base wanted that sweeping change. Clark was answering a demand from the left.</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>That's exactly right and exactly what went wrong. Yes, the base was fired up, and we watched the DNC shout "Go Wes Go" altogether, but a healthy coalition is more than your core supporters. You need to reach out to independents, moderates, and even across the aisle. You have to govern in prose, not poetry. Clark offered a manifesto, not a strategy.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>So, is this a rejection of progressive ideas?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Not entirely. It's a rejection of how they were sold. You want to reform the financial system? Sure, but you need to go at it carefully. You can't take an axe to a tree that reigns over your home.

Rahm, thanks for being here.</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Thanks, Anderson. It's always a pleasure.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Let's jump straight to it. President Clark ran an overly cautious and risk averse campaign, hugging establishment norms and presenting himself as Bush without the baggage. Losing what many felt was a turnout election. What did you feel on the ground?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Let's be clear: This was a wartime election. Financial institutions and the stock markets had begun to wither and decay before either party held its convention. We made the smart calculation that the American people were looking for calm, collected, and confident leadership able to steady the ship.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>But it didn't land. Voters didn't buy it. Republicans, Democrats, and independents entered the voting booths, hoping for change.</p> <p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>There's a difference between misreading the moment and respecting it. Republicans can promise the moon; Democrats explain how we will govern responsibly. It wasn't sexy, but it was serious, we offered maturity, respect for the institutions, and the character of our people that was on the line. It might have cost us flashy aesthetics, but it was not bad judgment.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>You say that, but internal memos, including one you allegedly authored, limited Clark's range. Instead of allowing the President to expand on bolder ideas that polled well even within swing states, you handed him a script with limited talking points.</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Governing isn't about pie in the sky promises; it's about building a machine able to win elections long term and creating a coalition that can reach independents and even those across the aisle.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>But you didn't win. You lost. Republicans won independents comfortably while youth and minority turnout collapsed for Democrats.</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p><b>[Pauses] </b>Anderson, It's easy to play visionary when you aren't in the room. The rising tides of challenges we faced would make anyone consider a laundry list of proposals, believe me. There was nothing we could do to change the fundamentals of the circumstances.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>With respect, Rahm, you were in the room. You helped shape a message that effectively failed to impress voters. How much farther can you compromise?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Alright, no. You are looking for a scapegoat, and I'm not your guy. We played the best cards we could on hand, and I'm proud of the campaign we ran. We did what we thought was right.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Even if that means you lost?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Sometimes, leadership is learning to lose the right way.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Or just losing.</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p><b>[Removes mic] </b>We're done here.</p>`)

<p><b>A New Mission for Chicago: Leadership. Integrity. Results.</b></p><p><b>Meet Wesley Clark</b></p><p>Born in Chicago in 1944, Wesley Clark is a decorated four-star general, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, and a former President. After retiring from the military, Wesley Clark relinquished his civilian life for a higher calling: the presidency. After valiantly leading the country, the former president has returned to his hometown, hoping to deliver the same kind of results he achieved for Americans nationwide.</p><p><b>Why I'm Running</b></p><p>Chicago stands at a crossroads. After two decades of entrenched politics and offering a slate of candidates out of touch with the people's needs, I stood up for the people, running a Draft Clark movement once more. The people of Chicago need a bold and swift action plan to propel the city into high gear. Other candidates in the race, such as Rahm Emanuel, come with a substantial war chest backed by a political elite that is out of touch with hard-working Chicagoans. I plan to lead a more accountable and ambitious city government to help you, Chicago.</p><p><b>The Clark Plan for Chicago</b></p><p><b>1. Safer Streets, Stronger Communities</b></p><p>Implement higher standards for police and drafting many more to keep our children safe.</p><p>Initiate advanced youth mentorship and after-school programs to prevent crimes before they happen.</p><p>Reinvigorate emergency response systems to ensure that when help is needed, it arrives as quickly as possible.</p><p><b>2. Economic Renewal for Every Ward</b></p><p>Launch a "Made in Chicago" initiative to encourage purchasing from local, homegrown businesses.</p><p>Enhance job creation infrastructure in both the private and public sectors, particularly in the fields of energy, cybersecurity, and healthcare.</p><p>Lower taxes on smaller businesses to ensure growth from the bottom up.</p><p><b>3. Education That Works</b></p><p>Guaranteed universal Pre-K for all Illinois families.</p><p>Funding increases for public schooling, as well as improvements to STEM and Art departments.</p><p>Combat rising tuition costs for colleges and the creation of a public fund for ROTC-based colleges to compete with private institutions.</p><p><b>Join the Movement</b></p><p>This campaign is about unleashing the potential of everyone in Chicago and bringing a progressive agenda unshackled from upper-class elitists.

e.pages.push(`<h3><i>Draft Clark 2012</i></h3>
<p><b>Draft Clark 2012?</b> Voters on the ground pass, but primary polling remains leading other major candidates.</p><p>As polling for the 2012 election mulls over in the minds of many voters in key states like Iowa and New Hampshire, the Democratic Party is grappling with the reality that if the former president were to run again, he'd likely win both contests. Iowa and New Hampshire were the key states that propelled Clark from a tight race with then-Senator John Kerry to stardom, painting the broader national race with his name. While other candidates build their national profile with rigorous whistle-stop tours through the states, the faint chanting of "Go Wes Go" remains in the background.</p><p>In 2008, when most polls indicated that Clark was to be swept up in a red tsunami amid the global recession, the president had rallied his party and presented a solid front to his record and ability to combat the crisis. In a polling upset, Clark outperformed expectations widely by 6-8 points nationally. While Republicans won the day, nonetheless, Democrats find it hard not to reward and commend the effort that effectively saved many of their careers, taking shelter under his name on the ballot.</p><p>When asked if he was thinking of running again, the former president claimed, "I don't like to make commitments to conflicts unless I know I'm needed." He declined to comment on the possibility of a run any further, and many suspect he's planning to sit this one out. The president stayed busy growing his business affairs, writing books, and running his cybersecurity tech firm, Clark & Co Cyberspace Protections. </p><p>Known candidates, such as Hillary Clinton, seemingly remain deathly afraid of the possibility of a Wesley Clark 2012 campaign. Former President Bill Clinton allegedly confronted Clark, asking him to stay out of the way. The often stubborn general, who had turned president, reportedly seemed annoyed while leaving his home in Chicago, Illinois.</p><p>If Clark were to jump into the race, he'd become the first former president to throw his hat into the ring of a presidential election since Herbert Hoover. Republicans often draw a connection between him and Hoover to drive home the point that the recession was a "Democrats fault." The messaging, however, proved unimpressive after the 2010 midterms, which saw Republicans undergo a severe lashing on every level of government. So, although Clark ranks 4th or 5th in national polling among Democratic candidates against the Republicans, he remains in the top 3 in the first 5 Democratic contests. The door is open to a Wesley Clark comeback to sweep the nation. It depends on whether the people of Iowa and New Hampshire are so forgiving.</p>`)

<p>Revolution recently rocked the balance of power in Ukraine, a development President Romney loudly praised as a rebuke of authoritarian control. The Russians, on the other hand, haven't been so keen on regime change and freely claimed that the United States was muddled in the politics of another country. While claiming there was no foul play on America's end, Secretary of State Robert Zoellick lambasted these claims and promised unilateral support to Ukraine's struggle for independence. </p><p>Ukraine underwent turbulent instability following the 2010 election. The Batkivshchyna party most sternly opposed Russian influence seeking a path to being admitted into the European Union and fiercely opposed agreements like the 2010 Ukrainian–Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas treaty and the incumbent government's close relations with Putin.</p><p>When the results came in, Yulia Tymoshenko of the Batkivshchyna Party won a plurality of the vote with 47.8% against Party of Religions candidate Viktor Yanukovych's 46.9%. Yanukovych immediately challenged the close results, and the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine suspended the results following an appeal, but due to Ukraine's constitution, Tymoshenko would be inaugurated before another election could be scheduled. </p><p>Yanukovych refused to concede nor withdraw his appeal, and soon, an armed conflict blew up in multiple regions along the Russian border backed by pro-Russian separatists. President Romney played quick geopolitics by recognizing the now pro EU led Ukrainian government while it hit utter turbulence.</p><p>Now, at its climactic hour with Putin eyeing up the Crimean peninsula as an easy grab, President Romney has issued his warning against any Russian attempts to take an inch of Ukrainian territory. "If Putin believes he can march into Crimea and take it for free, he has another thing coming. The highest sanctions will be thrust upon the Russian people for no reason other than for Putin's own hubris," Romney said during a CNN interview.</p><p>Administration outsiders claim Romney is only playing into Putin's hand with the aggressive stance. They cite former President Wesley Clark's failures to prevent Russian territorial gains during the Russo-Georgian war. Clark left office nearly humiliated by the conflict and his failure to prevent Georgia's capture.</p><p>President Romney now stands over a similar crisis. Just like his predecessor, he is attempting to hardball Putin, and it's unclear whether he or Putin will blink first.</p>`)

e.pages.push(`<h3>AP: <i>President Wesley K. Clark Defies Supreme Court Ruling on Foreclosure Moratorium Extension</i></h3>
<p><b>April 10, 2008 — Washington, D.C.</b></p><p>Executive-judicial tensions that had built up over the past weeks have now boiled over following the President's rebuke of the recent Supreme Court ruling on his extension of the nationwide foreclosure moratorium. The Court's finding that his executive order was, in fact, unconstitutional sparked Wesley Clark's escalation into a constitutional crisis that neither congressional Democrats nor Republicans seemed interested in interfering with.</p><p>President Clark, reelected in November 2008 on the strength of his administration's response to the recession, had initially been issued the moratorium weeks before the election at the height of the housing crisis. When presenting his wide-ranging bailout initiative, he regarded the bill as "the failsafe to save America." While the original moratorium, enacted with congressional support, was set to expire in November 2009, Clark's recent unilateral extension via executive order was struck down in a 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court, citing separation of powers and a lack of legislative authority.</p><p>Almost as if the President was quoting Andrew Jackson himself, Clark responded to the ruling at a Monday press briefing, "The Court has made its opinion known, and so have I. I'd like to see them enforce it. I answer to America, not a political bench held by echoes of a bygone era."</p><p>The White House continues to argue that the President holds unilateral authority, citing that the American economy is beginning to affect foreign policy. White House Chief of Staff commented, saying, "We are choosing stability over procedure, and for the President to effectively manage the country's foreign policy, we need a stable home front.</p><p>Legal scholars are deeply divided on the events, arguing that the President's actions risk setting a precedent that could destroy judicial authority for years to come. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, a former Harvard president, is noticeably quiet on the issue, simply carrying out the President's directives.</p><p>Yet the President's approval ratings continue to surge, particularly among working-class and minority groups still recovering from the financial crash. Recent Gallup polls show that the approval of the moratorium has risen to 68%, while approval of Clark's recent actions lags not far behind at 59%.</p><p>Republican congressional leaders remain paralyzed following a failure to launch an impeachment inquiry over the President's actions. House Republican Leader Eric Cantor has quietly pulled the effort following a private conference proving unable to secure enough votes within his ranks.</p><p>Private sources say that several GOP House members are afraid to be seen siding with banks over the people. An undisclosed Congressman stated, "We're looking down the scope of complicated numbers for the midterms and Clark continues to surprise us, so it's best if we just ride this one out."</p><p>Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has declined to issue further comments. Legal observers note that the judiciary lacks the cards to wage a war on the executive. The U.S. Marshal Service, responsible for enforcing the Court's decisions, remains under the control of the Justice Department, which the President has a firm hand on.</p><p>As the branches of government prepare for a first shot, what remains clear is that the moratorium on foreclosures will stay in place following the President's political gamble, which redraws the lines of Executive Power.</p>`)

President Clark remarked, "In my study of this problem and experience over the years, this means transforming gradually, systematically from a workplace centered private payer system toward some greater reliance on some form of a single-payer system to ease administrative burdens and reduce cost!"</p> <p>He's a liar; every single economist will tell you that healthcare to the extreme he wants will explode prices and require every American to give even more to the government, and we'll get tiny in return!</p> <p>Republicans and Democrats need to step up and dismantle the Clark Regime, but I doubt many of the Democratic Party are willing to stand up against their king given that they passed the stepping stone, Clark Care.

Last week, on the snowy stage in Davos, Clark assembled his internationalist goons to stand beside him and deliver a love letter to globalism.</p><p>Flanked by internationalist elites, prissy bankers, climate bureaucrats, and IMF kingpins, Clark hailed the work of none other than British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, yes, that same architect of the UK's spend all you can give bailout binge for his "visionary leadership" during the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>So what was Clark's grand idea to hoist upon the rest of us? A "New Transatlantic Recovery Alliance" will be established to combat current and future global recessions before they start. A never-ending list of deals of demands that stinks of globalist greed and hunger. </p><p><b>Clark-Brown Pact: The Globalist Pie in The Sky</b></p><p>Clark foretold of an invisible threat that threatened the balance of international order if it was not dealt with in time. He wants coordinated fiscal stimulus, financial regulatory alliances, and a New architecture for trust between Western powers. In simpler terms, he wants to remodel the American economy by the Canadian regulations and give the off-and-on switch to freedom-killing bureaucrats in Brussels and London.</p><p>This relinquishment of the Founding Fathers' vision for America would create more joint trade agreements, oversight boards for banking, and shared equity funds propped up by foreign investors. Here's the real kicker: a Global Economic Reform Council chair by Gordon Brown.</p><p>Your eyes aren't deceiving you. The man who is now under assault by his country's opposition party for failing to save the British pound wants to help manage the dollar.</p><p><b>Is Clark Just the Face of a Deeper Agenda?</b></p><p>Never forget that Clark was a Rhodes Scholar, groomed to be of the same type of globalist academic pipeline as Bill Clinton, who shares with him the title of being only one of two United States presidents to attend the World Economic Forum summit in Davos. This isn't new; it's a culmination of decades of work infiltrating America's top brass of leadership.</p><p>And now, with millions of Americans still hurting from the economic crisis, Clark is performing a surrender of the Constitution.</p><p>If you ask me, this isn't just about economics. It's one of many steps taken to create a transnational economic regime that undermines the groundwork laid by Washington to allow for a new political infrastructure led by WEF hustlers to take the wheel.</p><p><b>What Comes Next?</b></p><p>Don't be surprised if Clark shoots for bolder moves like:</p><p><b>A North American assimilation project to bind us to Canada and Mexico.</b></p><p><b>Military intelligence agreements to protect global markets.</b></p><p><b>Climate agreements bound by executive order</b></p><p>The path is currently under construction; the elites have made their demands, but real Americans are waking up in time to reject them and declare independence before Clark and Brown sign away our rights with a smile and handshake!</p><p>Stay vigilant, patriots.</p><p><b>Tags: </b>#WesleyClark #GordonBrown #Globalism #WEF #Davos2009 #SovereigntyUnderSiege #AltHistory</p>`)

<p><b>Kyle Doyle</b> - Economist with an Opinion on everything<u> Experienced in government and diplomacy Author has <b>2.6K</b> answers and <b>789.3K</b> answer views Updated 3m</u></p> <p>Resigning is putting the events nicely. It's safe to say that Republicans have not been able to heal the wounds left by the 2008 election disaster. The wounds are only a symptom of the growing friction between Republicans—congressmen like Boehner, who were holdovers from the Gingrich-led "Contract with America" era, and those who have joined Congress more recently. The Tea Party Movement quickly grew after the wilderness period following the dramatic defeat of George W. Bush's compassionate conservatism wing of the party in 2004.</p><p>Boehner had the label of a "compromiser" stuck to his forehead and would quickly lose grip over Congress after he helped pass different aspects of the Clark agenda. I suspect that Boehner has grown tired of the role, given the incessant dogfight that became the passage of the Matthew Shepard Act, which only boiled further Tea Party frustration with his tenure. Republicans are angry, and the loss to Wesley Clark last year put a deep dent in party morale. Boehner couldn't effectively channel that rage as a leader of the opposition.</p> <p><b>Marty Mascili</b> - I have studied my opposition my entire lifetime and i know them as well or better than my own side.<u>Author <b>40K</b> answers and <b>647k</b> answer views . Updated 9m</u></p>   <p>He's cashing in when the donors are clamoring for a change in leadership. Tea Party assholes botched the election for us by making Republicans look like jackasses, and now this. Think that I'm wrong? Imagine this: the most likely successor to take Boehner's position is Mike Pence, who failed to win party leadership in 2007. Now he's spearheading the drop John movement. I'll List my top 3 reasons I believe hes resigning for.</p><p><b>No power;</b> it was widely expected that Republicans would sweep the House in 2008, but in the exodus of a humiliating loss, the Republican base is hungry for change. Failing to win an election is one thing; failing to form an opposition to the incumbent party's legislation coherently is worse.</p> <p><b>His career has hit a plateau;</b> it was unlikely that Republicans would ever look to John Boehner as an optimal presidential or vice presidential candidate as they did for Speaker Gingrich. Although they are of the same ideology, Gingrich, at the height of his career, was a Republican trailblazer, and even then, the party would grow tired of him soon after 1996. I'll note that Gingrich might be planning a presidential run now, but it's a long shot. Boehner has nowhere to go but down, so he might try to bail himself out to avoid further shame on his legacy.</p><p><b>Something is coming, something terrible;</b> we can't ignore the previous speaker, Dennis Hastert, who underwent extreme career-ending allegations of pedophilia. Boehner, if not convinced to retire by the rapid growth of partisan politics in the Republican Party, might be running to escape something. All I'm saying is to keep a lookout for some damning evidence of wrongdoing on his part.</p><p><b>Sandy Dillon</b> - Mom who knows her stuff <u>Author has <b>1.1K</b> answers and <b>99.3K</b> answer views 6m</u></p><p>Republicans are tired of party leadership after consistent disappointment in both 2004, 2006, and 2008. Wesley Clark, ever coming within a sniff of the presidency, was a mistake, and he swept through the Senate, claiming a bare majority while still losing those who were promised a bold opposition party. Instead, we got a collapsing Republican leadership in the House, from Tom Delay's indictment to the Terri Schiavo nonsense backfiring. It all hit us twice as hard. The outcome of the last election shocked the world, and Republicans still can't pick up the pieces from the loss. McConnell should look to Boehner's resignation as an example of fear. Now we're hearing of more Republican Senators like Nevada's John Ensign possibly being involved in an affair. Democrats smell weakness. It's time for Republicans to get tough.</p>`)

<p>If you don't know who to vote for in the 2012 elections and are having a hard time keeping track of who said what among the 11 candidates, help is here. ABC News and USA Today have created the Match-O-Matic, a cheery little game that asks you a handful of questions about the Economy, Immigration, Health Care and Hot Topics (gay marriage, taxation, global warming, and a candidate's experience) before spitting out a list of three candidates whose views are closest to yours. A scorecard on the side shows where you agreed and disagreed, and displays a short quote from the candidate addressing each issue.</p><p>The first time I tried, I answered as honestly as I could, without trying to influence the choice in a more liberal or conservative direction. That gave me Tom Steyer, Bernie Sanders and Caroline Kennedy as 1-2-3.</p><p>I tried again, this time being a bit more "realistic"—meaning conservative—with my answers. This time I got Joe Sestak, Tom Daschle and Rod Blagojevich.</p><p>Unfortunately the site says nothing about the methodology behind the game other than a statement that appears briefly on one screen that says "Answers gathered from statements and speeches by candidates and catalogued by USA Today." Not a very enlightening explanation of the research behind the game.</p><p>The final question on experience annoys me. Here are your choices:</p><p>What if I have no preference, or want both "U.S. Senate" and "served in military," or "has run a business" and "served as governor or mayor"? No go.</p><p>I don't know how heavily this question is weighted, but you can see that a single answer can push your choice toward a specific candidate.</p><p>So, is this anything more than a fun way to spend a few minutes on a Monday night? Actually, I think it is. I never gave a thought to Tom Steyer or Joe Sestak, but now I'm going to learn more about them. Sadly, of course, none of my top three candidates have a snowball's chance in hell of being on the ballot.</p><p>If you want more than a fun, painless suggestion on who to vote for, try the VoteMatch quiz instead. It's not as slick but is much more thoughtful. The questions are similar, but you give your answer on a scale of 1 to 5, from "Support" to "Oppose." Each question links to a detailed explanation of the topic, explaining what each answer means, giving background information and defining "buzzwords" often tossed around when the topic is discussed.</p><p>VoteMatch quiz results screen Steyer was at the top of my list again, but Clinton popped up at number two, and there's Caroline Kennedy again, coming in third.</p><p>You can answer the questions as quickly as with Match-O-Matic, maybe even faster because you don't have to wait for spiffy graphics to update. You can also take your time and read extensive background information on the questions and on the candidates when you get your results.</p><p>The site is quite transparent about its content and staff. Staff members are named, with a bit of information about each. You can find links to the source material used to determine a candidate's position on an issue. Steyer, for example, has listed 17 quotes on the Environment, 5 on Economic Equality, and 2 on Healthcare. Blagojevich has 26 on Anti Corruption, 10 on Crime, and 20 on Taxes. As Illinois Governor, his record on these topics are also shown.</p><p>Most importantly, for each possible answer in the VoteMatch quiz you can see exactly what statement by the candidate was used to determine his/her position as well as the number of points the answer is worth. Much more helpful than the "behind the green curtain" approach of Match-O-Matic. Give them both a try and let us know how it works out by clicking "Comments" below.</p> <p><b>Update (October 30, 2012)</b>It's hard to believe that anyone might be undecided after all the publicity about both candidates, but just in case... I've explained my reasons for voting for Steyer in an essay titled <b>What if?</b></p>`)

<p><b>By Andrew Scott</b></p> <p>American International Group was saved while on the brink of collapse during the 2008 Great Recession by then President Clark's administration and at the time it was justified as a “non-negotiable” to save the economy. Now just a year later The Washington Post has broken the story that AIG plans to use part of the bailout funds to payout over 165 million dollars worth of bonuses to 400 employees.</p> <p>The outrage stirred by multiple news organizations like The New York Times which reminded us “the same business unit that brought the company to the brink of collapse last year.” National outrage over an almost comical situation followed the story's landfall. President Huckabee has propelled himself to the forefront of this outrage threatening executive action against AIG if it were to follow through with these bonus bailouts. “America had to foot the bill for your mistakes and now you want to use that money to pat yourselves on the back for a good job?” Huckabee said when addressing the controversy.</p><p>It's a strange unifying movement behind the outrage between the left and right with Independent and self proclaimed socialist Senator Bernie Sanders passionately denouncing the scandal. Many are advocating that President Huckabee go after AIG and force them to repay the bailouts by the end of the year. Huckabee has flirted with the idea and also debated shutting down all government agencies used to bailout private firms and businesses.</p><p>Arguments in favor of AIG's position state that AIG would have trouble attracting and retaining talent “if employees believe their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury.” The Huckabee Administration has found thus totally unacceptable and signaled that action against the bonuses will be taken in some form.</p><p><b>Related Articles</b></p><span style="color:blue;"><u>Impeachment?

She gave her public statement statement to NBC News reporters here:</p> <p>"After my son passed, I learned that he had several discussions about homosexuality with school administrators and was told that being gay was a choice, he was told that he was making a mistake. My son is dead, he wasn't a mistake, he wasn't making a choice and you are the people responsible for this.

They constantly tell me I'm a mistake, I don't know who found out I was gay but the rumor spread around the whole school and I feel other kids are constantly watching me. My friends won't talk to me anymore and when I tried to bring it up with Mrs. Shelby told me being gay was a choice. I don't know how I made the choice but I feel wrong and I just want everything to go back to normal. I want to be normal, but I can't. I don't know why I'm like this.

<p><b>Josephine Moulds</b></p> <p>According to a leading international think tank, China will overtake the U.S. economy in the next two years and become the largest economy in the world by 2013.</p> <p>The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that due to the U.S. economy hitting its 7th consecutive quarter of GDP decline since President Brownback's "Great American Tax Experiment," China can overtake the U.S. economy by the end of 2012. Asa Johansson, senior economist at the OECD, said: "It is quite a shift in the balance of economic power we are going to see in the future."</p><p>The tax cuts were the largest in American history and caused massive budget shortfalls. To save the economy, the Republican House cut deep into education and transportation spending, which received an equally large backlash. When the 2010 midterms came, the massive majority Republicans held in both the Senate and House was obliterated. Now facing a volatile Democratic caucus, President Brownback has stubbornly barked at any reversal of his policies.</p><p>The global shockwave of the 2007-2008 global financial crash allowed this development's conditions to take place. Although the crash also hit China, the U.S. hit more significant downturns, and President Brownback's government mismanagement has turned what was once a recession into a full-scale depression, the likes of which hasn't been seen since the 1930s.</b></p><p>A bipartisan coalition is forming in the House and Senate, and it seeks to repeal most of the President's tax cuts despite his assurances that a bright future is ahead of the country. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led the movements to repeal the tax cuts shortly after the 2010 midterms saw Democrats retake the House in a strong rebuke of the President. Whether repealing the tax cuts can reverse China's emergence as the world's leading economy remains to be seen.</p><p><b>Thu 2 Jan 2011 07.11 EST</b></p>`)

President Clark justified the decision at a press conference where he stated:</p><p>"If these people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they are disloyal to the United States as a matter of principle, fine. It's their right and it's our right and obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict, if someone supported Nazi Germany at the expense of the United States, we didn't say that was freedom of speech, we put him in a camp, they were prisoners of war."</p><p>This was in response to heavy criticism of his decision to remain in Iraq and Afghanistan and expand drone warfare, taking out targets in Pakistan and Syria.

<p>Bankruptcy F.C. is a British television sitcom, created by Matt Berry and Arthur Matthews, starring Berry as George Dross, a banker at Barclays who must take his charity football league seriously when the bank collapses during the <b>Global Recession</b>. The sitcom was critically acclaimed and earned Berry the 2012 BAFTA Award for Best Male Comedy Performance.</p><p><b>Series 1 (2011)</b></p><p><b>Episode 1:</b></p><p>George comes home from work at Barclays to learn that his entire company has crashed due to its acquisition of Lehman Brothers, with George having been part of the Lehman Brothers acquisition team. Out of a job, he is despondent about his chances, as his association with Lehman brothers makes him a banking pariah. However, George realizes that Barclays has submitted a team to a charity football league with a prize of $300,000 pounds, which goes to the charity of the winning team’s captain’s choosing.</p><p>The next day, George officially joins the team, not revealing his true intentions to the rest of the players. When one of the players has to withdraw due to an STD, George recruits his sister Miranda, a professional pole-vaulter and all-around athlete, to the team. The team wins their first match after George and Miranda become embroiled in an argument on the field, distracting most of the players and allowing the Barclays striker to walk home the winning goal.</p><p><b>Episode 2:</b></p><p>George’s teammate Devin, also unemployed, undergoes a divorce after his wife learns that he spent all of the couple’s money on cleats for the team. George and Miranda attempt to cheer Devin up by hiring a call girl, but things go haywire when the call girl turns out to be extremely attractive and intelligent, causing Devin to consider immediately starting a relationship with her.</p><p>After learning that he hired the call girl before their divorce was finalized, Devin’s wife forces him to publicly humiliate himself in a series of embarrassing tasks on the streets of London so that she doesn’t use it for leverage in their divorce settlement. George and Miranda attempt to re-contact the call girl to warn her to stay away from Devin, but to no avail. In the team’s game, although they face the prospect of a draw against a weaker side, Devin sees the call girl in the stands and she flashes her breasts at him, giving him the courage to convert a bicycle kick from outside the goalie box, winning the game.</p></b></p>Episode 3:<p><b><p>While manipulating a friend into buying him an expensive lunch, George learns that many of the bankers have orchestrated golden parachutes for themselves in case of Barclays’ failure, leaving them unscathed by the collapse. Infuriated, George starts an argument with his old boss, which accidentally leads to the old boss, drunk and angry, falling out of the restaurant to his death. George is then arrested for manslaughter.</p><p>Due largely to George’s imprisonment, the team loses the next game. Miranda attempts to contact the boss’ family in order to explain what had happened, but is unable to locate a single family member who speaks of him positively. In a last-ditch effort, Miranda attends his funeral, but finds herself accidentally conducting the entire ceremony. After the ceremony, Miranda locates the boss’ only child, Lyudmila, the result of the boss’ “obsession with Ukrainian hookers.” Miranda is able to seduce Lyudmila and get her to advocate for George, leading to him being released from jail after a set of wild adventures behind bars.</p><p><b>Episode 4:</b></p><p>While looking for a fish and chips shop that he can actually afford, George accidentally wanders into a sketchy part of London and finds himself inside an illegal bookie’s shop. The bookie recognizes George from a story about Lehman Brothers’ failure and offers him a deal to throw the league’s games in exchange for more money than he could earn from winning the league. George gladly accepts, though the bookie warns him that there will be hell to pay should he fail.</p><p>At the team’s next game, George tries his best to lose purposefully, but Miranda, with Lyudmila cheering her on, has the game of her life and scores a hat-trick, winning the game handily. George fearfully tries to evade the bookie’s men, as they are accidentally incapacitated one by one while trying to locate him. Finally, the bookie himself finds and threatens to stab George while the two of them are in Trafalgar Square. However, the bookie’s exaggerated mannerisms and clothing, alongside George’s boisterous counters, convince the crowd that the two of them are acting out a live performance. The crowd showers them with money, allowing the bookie to cover his losses and George to escape intact.</p><p><b>Episode 5:</b></p><p>The team loses a heartbreaker of a match, making the league’s last game an all-or-nothing affair. In search of a spark of inspiration for the team, George announces a surprise trip to Washington D.C. after winning a televised prize competition whose reward is British Airways miles. The team is excited to visit America, but soon learns that it was not all they had hoped it would be, as despair and political polarization are omnipresent on the Washington streets.</p><p>George realizes that the team is despondent and almost certain to lose their next game, and decides to cheer them up by taking them to a cultural exchange program held at the Kennedy Center, where the British team can take joy in their favorite pastime of belittling Americans. While the team is midway through the cultural program, finding little success, the American President (a fictionalized version of <b>Wesley Clark</b>, played by <b>Anthony Head</b>) drops by as a surprise guest. George, still upset at the U.S. government for allowing Lehman brothers to fail, tears into the President for his economic missteps, pointing to his dreadful approval rating and causing him to cry in front of the team. Realizing that George went too far, Miranda comforts him one-on-one, and cheers him back up by talking about his past bombing Serbians and how she, as a Brit, thinks that “<b>Mike Jackson</b> is an idiot.” The newly cheerful President gives a roaring pep talk, breathing new life into the team.</p><p><b>Episode 6:</b></p><p>The team faces its toughest opponent yet in the charity league: HSBC UK, which has now replaced Barclays as the largest bank in Britain. In the first half, the HSBC team races out to a 3-1 lead over Barclays, with their players openly mocking the Barclays team for being out of a job. At halftime, the team is ready to give up, but George reminds them how much more money they have at stake than the employed HSBC team does. This realization sparks the team to new heights, and they dominate the second half, with George assisting Miranda on a header to win the game and league in stoppage time.</p><p>Upon being presented with the winner’s check, George announces his plans to donate it to the “Doss Liberation Fund,” and vanishes from the rest of the squad. A flashback set two months later shows George, Miranda, and Lyudmila on the beach in Greece, where they marvel at how affordable the country has become for them after its <b>debt crisis</b>. George takes a phone call from a former team member demanding to know where the money is, but laughs and hangs up before toasting the two women, who toast back.</p>`)

<p>Liberals always give me a good laugh. They make a big stink of things and then get into power sniffing the same shit they complained about!</p><p>They always march around wagging the finger, 'Oh no you can't do that, Mr. President, we shouldn't have invaded Iraq' while they voted for it and practically made American soldiers residents there for a decade. That's how we got President Wesley Clark. Oh, you remember him? How could you not? He's on TV every day sporting his same PowerPoint patriotism and the promise of fixing American wars that won the day over that moron Bush.</p><p>It sounded good, right? "No more wars." "We'll finally finish the ones we got." "Fenito!"</p><p>So what does he do now after finally pulling us from Iraq? A big ole military U-turn sending more fresh meat—oh, I mean soldiers into Afghanistan to fight off an incoming Taliban resurgence. Oh, what you didn't hear about that? Well, that's because it doesn't exist! The Taliban is still just hiding in the mountains while America attempts to hold out in the longest staring contest ever before seen!</p><p>That's like robbing a bank and putting the money back nicely, only to walk into a second one wearing a bomb vest and screaming, "We got momentum now."</p><p>Oh, you want the reason? Stability, strategy, suicide vests, sand. Whatever it doesn't matter, we're in for the long haul, holding metal detectors over the desert, hoping to find the lucky pot of democracy Bush Jr. was so adamant about finding.</p><p>So President Clark, General Clark, Commander Clark, or whatever title he's parading around with this week, decided that we needed to go back to war, or else the war would travel across the Atlantic and beat us in a game of poker or something.</p><p>What I can tell you is that I'd rather focus on the wars I'm fighting here—fighting with Comcast and my damn landlord.</p><p>But hey, that's the American way we were all taught as young kids. We go to war for peace, we kill to protect human rights, and we drop democracy out of the back of a B-52.</p><p>Wesley Clark didn't change how we fought wars; he just found a way to make them look more pretty—by wearing stars and ribbons.</p>`)

<p><b>By James Naughtie</b></p><p><b>Special Correspondent, Radio 4 News</b></p><p><b>9 July 2010</b></p><p><b>---</b></p><p><b>A Fall Few Could Have Predicted</b></p><p>If you went back in time to 1997 and told the average Brit that the super-star icon who had swept them off their feet and to the polls would be where he is now, they'd have a good laugh. Now, as we live history in the moment, there are cheers and laughs. Tony Blair has marched his party into an early grave due to his ego and hopes to regain his stolen valor from his previous failings.</p><p><b>---</b></p><p><b>Collapse from Within</b></p><p>Echoing shock and horror from the Blair campaign headquarters only served to further question where the Prime Minister believed he was taking his party. It's not like polls ever favored his chances or his ability to claim victory. After Chancellor Brown's dramatic exit in late 2009 following the announcement of Blair's intentions to run for another term, the Labour Party began to spiral out of stability and grace.</p><p><b>---</b></p><p><b>From Magic to Missteps</b></p><p>When Blair triumphed over Major in a stunning rebuke of Thatcherism, the world clapped as near magic swept through the country. Welcomed by President Bill Clinton, their relationship grew strong with diplomatic ties that would further expand to George W. Bush.</p><p>That is where the trouble began. When the September 11th attacks struck the heart of America, Blair stood by Bush as a showing of solidarity. He then followed Bush into both Afghanistan and, more controversially, Iraq—sinking British credibility on the American promise that Saddam Hussain held nuclear capabilities.</p><p>When the Bush administration came up short in providing evidence for such claims, so did Blair.</p><p><b>---</b></p><p><b>The Magnetism of Controversy</b></p><p>From then on, controversy would stick to Blair like a magnet, and despite coming out of the 2005 election victorious, the Labour Party was stung by the losses. The magic that captivated the country was rapidly dissipating, and rumors of a rift between Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor Brown circled the media.</p><p>It was then Blair was offered a blessing: General Wesley Clark had stormed onto the American political scene, decapitating the Bush administration before it could cause him any more trouble. President Clark won the 2004 election on the promise that he would bring a change in strategy to Iraq. That change would be a firm withdrawal deadline, offering Blair political room to wiggle around Brown's threats of resigning and continuing his premiership.</p><p><b>---</b></p><p><b>Iraq, Again, and the Temptation of a Fourth Term</b></p><p>Working closely with President Clark, they handled Iraq and all of its controversy together. Withdrawing from Iraq would become Blair's championing policy—which apparently made him pursue an ambitious fourth term.</p><p>Speculation that Blair would call the election in mid-to-late 2009 caught the Conservative Party flat footed, and polls showed a possible Blair victory at hand if the election were to be called.</p><p>What Blair hadn't expected was the fury from Chancellor Gordon Brown, who expected him to step aside for the party's sake. Brown resigned, causing a total meltdown within the Labour Party and effectively killing Blair's hope to call an election early—with Labour MPs loudly against it.</p><p><b>---</b></p><p><b>The Beginning of the End</b></p><p>So Blair had to watch his potential victory squandered by an unwilling Labour Party. David Cameron's Conservative Party would then rebound in the polls after the good feelings from the Iraq withdrawal faded and the economic woes returned.</p><p>Blair slowly marched through the end of 2009 to 2010, deeply scarred by Brown's exit. Remaining determined to ride out the general election despite horrific polling across the provinces, he charged at the poor circumstances head-on—now promising a continuation of the economic recovery from the 2008 recession.</p><p>Meanwhile, David Cameron effectively poised himself as a change leader who would end the chaos brought through the 2000s. As the past decade and the next came to clash, Cameron proved himself a winning bet as his party trounced over Blair's in a landslide—the final rebuke to the long-running Labour Party rule under Blair.</p><p><b>---</b></p><p><b>The Final Report Card</b></p><p>The election marked itself as a performance report for Prime Minister Tony Blair, a report which would come very negative for him and his party. Tony Blair would then concede, ending Labour's dominance and allowing a Conservative vision to take the 2010s by storm.</p>`)

<p>The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research met yesterday by conference call. At its meeting, the committee determined a trough in business activity in the US economy in June 2010. The trough marks the end of the recession that began in December 2007 and the beginning of an expansion.</p><p>The recession's length exceeded most economists' expectations following the sudden collapse of General Motors due to Congressional deadlock, which prevented any economic bailout of these corporations. Just two of the many American financial institutions collapsed during the heat of the recession in 2008 and would later be followed by the collapse of AIG, "American International Group" in February 2009."</p><p>President Wesley Clark, frustrated by the lack of action, chastised Congress often following his reelection and made it his first priority to break the congressional deadlock, eventually breaking a deal of a 450 Billion stimulus bill that established the TARP program, which would be used to bail out Bank of America.</p><p>The committee's declaration of the end of a recession does not mean that the economy has recovered. Most institutions have yet to get back on their feet, and most families across America still feel the effects of the recession.</p><p>The declaration was followed by President Clark, who stated, "Economists may believe the recession has ended, but American families are still struggling to pay their bills day to day, and it's our job to offer more relief to the American people. The Republican Congress begs to differ, with most Republican leadership opposing further aid, citing the budget.</p><p>"Due to the lack of improvement in the labor market, particularly the stubbornly high unemployment rate, the recovery still feels like a recession to many households," said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.

<p><b>Updated March 4, 2011, 11:49 PM EST By NBC News</b></p> <p>President Clark's resurrection of the Home Owners Loan Corporation amid the 2008 financial crisis was a drastic solution, and to most at the time, it was necessary. The bill, which reestablished the corporation along with a 1.1 trillion dollar bailout, was put forward by Senator Hillary Clinton (New York) and was credited for the late surge in President Clark's re-election polling and eventual victory over his Republican opponent.</p><p>Today, the corporation accounts for nearly 15 percent of owner-occupied nonfarm mortgages. Many credit it as a necessary lifeline to millions of families across the United States.</p><p>However, Republican primary candidates feel much differently. Governor Rick Perry (Texas) has taken the lead in the discussion, blaming President Clark's "destructive homeownership policies" as the leading cause of the housing crisis. Other candidates like former Senator Rick Santorum, who ran in the 2008 Republican primaries, tend to agree. In particular, Santorum has been scrutinized after taking out a loan with the corporation himself when a tax assessment of his $2 million, five-acre home fell 25% in value. The former Senator's polling has dropped after the revelation came to light.</p><p>President Clark and the Democratic Party have stood by the corporation and hailed it as a success despite the sluggish economy. Vice President Landrieu has staked part of her presidential campaign on allowing the corporation to continue its work in the face of Republican calls to disband it.</p><p>As Democrats pick up the pieces of the steep losses during the midterms, the corporation's results have become a beacon of light for the party to coalesce around. It's hard to deny that the message "We kept you in your homes" isn't powerful. Republican deficit hawks claim billions of dollars are wasted within the corporation's work, but polls show at least 55% of Americans approve of the Home Owners Loan Corporation, while 39% disapprove and 6% are unsure.</p>`)

Senator Clinton has come under fire from many other Democratic opponents like John Edwards for working too closely with the Bush administration.</p><p>Mr. Trump then went into a tirade, lambasting President Bush, claiming he was a "no show on the job" getting paid to go on vacations abroad and asking, "Why would you pay a man $400,000 a year for a no-show job?" Much of the reality TV host's candidacy has been orbiting President Bush's failures to protect the American worker from "immigrants taking our jobs" and his push for free trade deals that "sell American farmers out."</p><p>The once-crowded field of establishment Democratic candidates has slowly dwindled after Trump's surprising victory in Iowa and the New Hampshire upset outcome of Senator Bernie Sanders taking the plurality.

<p><b>Rich Mims</b></p><p><b>Daily Inter Lake</b></p><p><b>November 8, 2012</b></p><p><b>LAKESIDE, MONTANA–</b> Ben Garrison, a political cartoonist and illustrator who rose to prominence in 2010 for his deep-seated admiration for President Ron Paul, was found dead in his home in Lakeside, Montana from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Garrison, who died at age 55, was found at home by his wife Tina, who had left the house to run errands.</p><p>Garrison, who was raised in Washington and Texas, received a B.A. in art before working as an artist for the San Angelo Standard Times and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer before moving to Montana in 2009. Garrison, who considered himself a libertarian and voted for Ron Paul in 2008, began drawing politician cartoons shortly after his move to Montana, inspired by the “negative perception of Ron Paul in the media.” Garrison began posting political cartoons on his website and on political message boards.</p><p>Garrison’s political cartoons, which followed a general libertarian and right-wing theme, often made references to conspiracy theories and fringe politics, with various commentators describing them as sexist, racist, anti-feminist, xenophobic, anti-government, and anti-semitic. Garrison had a noted love of President Paul, however, whom he often depicted as an extremely vibrant, strong, muscular fighter in contrast to the real-life Paul’s advanced age and normal build.</p><p>In 2010, Garrison attracted national attention for his cartoon entitled “Tyranny of the Minority,” depicting Republican Maine Senator Olympia Snowe and Democratic Illinois Senator Dick Durbin stabbing President Paul in the back while dressed in togas, inside a Roman-style building with the words “Global Elitist Headquarters” written on it. The cartoon was posted thousands of times on the internet and was even covered by mainstream news outlets, who noted the humorous level of agony on Paul’s face. Following the success of the cartoon, Garrison was able to focus on political cartooning full-time, even scoring an invite to the White House and a personal meeting with Paul in 2011.</p><p>In the months leading up to Garrison’s death, he often expressed deep anxiety over the prospect of an Obama presidency, and donated a substantial amount of money to the Montana Republican Party to unsuccessfully keep Obama from flipping the state. In the days leading up to his death, Garrison’s comics became more extreme and conspiratorial, with Garrison insisting that a Paul reelection was the only way to avoid a national catastrophe, with his wife claiming that Garrison had a mental breakdown on Election Day after Obama’s landslide 14-point victory.</p><p>At the moment, Lakeside police are ruling Garrison’s death a suicide, pointing to the ballistic results showing no evidence of foul play and a lengthy suicide note next to Garrison’s body matching his handwriting, in which he claimed that he could not live any more due to the prospect of an “African globalist” winning the presidency and his “brave Texan knight” being defeated. Garrison’s wife has set up a link to fund his funeral on his personal website, as well as a thank-you message to his fans.</p>`)

<p><b>Jack Wells</b></p> <p>President Ron Paul's tenure in the Oval Office has become nothing short of disastrous for the Republican Party. From the downward spiral of an economic recession to a full-scale depression, the task put on his shoulders would never be easy. This isn't to say that he hadn't dug his own political grave somewhat. From the collapse of banks nationwide and the eventual axing of key government programs and agencies, his name soon became political poison as Republicans down-ballot attempted to run away from the political landfall of his collapsing mandate.</p><p>Following the disastrous midterms, among the first to announce their intentions to stop President Paul's renomination was House Minority Leader Eric Cantor. Running on a promise to return the Republican Party to "responsible conservativism," his announcement seemingly opened the door for a whole band of kooks and nuts. Most surprising was the entrance of now-fired General Stanley McChrystal, who ran on a promise of returning the United States to NATO.</p><p>President Paul shifted focus on reelection soon after declaring his intentions to run as a Republican again. However, as the campaign began, attacks came down on his rule from every angle. Cantor focused on fiscal irresponsibility, McChrystal concentrated on foreign policy failures, and former Judge Roy Moore went after Paul for his social libertarianism. When the major candidates came to blows at Iowa, Paul suffered a humiliating first defeat at the hands of McChrystal, who beat him in the suffering farm state by nearly 6 points. The President continued his quest to keep the presidency but would soon be shockingly defeated in New Hampshire, falling third place behind Cantor and McChrystal.</p><p>Following two defeats, his chances looked especially grim as South Carolina quickly approached. Moore, who focused heavily on winning the state, led polls by 3 points over McChrystal, while Paul trailed by over 6%. Polls proved correct as Moore took the state by storm while Paul continued to rant about his party's betrayal.</p><p>So, where does this campaign move from here? Many have floated ideas, such as Paul relinquishing part of his administration to the establishment and possibly even dropping Vice President Johnson to claw back support.

<p><b>SAINT PAUL, MINNESOTA– During his latest campaign rally, President Huckabee announced that in his next term, he plans to force Muslim-Americans to identify themselves by wearing a star and crescent patch that will be stitched onto their clothing. According to Huckabee, “The Islamic religion will have to adapt itself to sound constructive activity as other nations do, or sooner or later it will succumb to a crisis of an inconceivable magnitude.” This statement was widely praised in the mainstream media, with the New York Times describing Huckabee’s statement as “tough love which Muslims would do well to appreciate.” In an appearance on Fox News held the day after the rally, Huckabee expanded on his plans further, saying that “After we have the badges, I think it would be for the best if we built areas where Muslims can concentrate. Of course, we would want this to be as easy as possible for them, so we could build train lines right up to these concentration… places, even try to spruce these areas up with amenities like fences and showers. At press time, sources with Democrat Keith Ellison’s campaign confirmed that Ellison had criticized Huckabee’s statements, but that nobody had bothered to listen to him.</b></p>`)

<p>18 hours ago</p><p><b>Kelly Agner</b> BBC News</p><p>At midnight on October 11th, 2010, an explosion was heard from the fabled Nord Stream Pipeline being created to pump Russian gas into Europe. With ongoing investigations, I will look into the possible culprits of the attack.</p><p><b>Suspect #1:</b> The Americans</p><p>American opposition to the Nord Stream pipeline creation was not some hidden secret. From its very signing under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, President Wesley Clark forewarned the deal to pump Russian gas to Germany's ports via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline as an easy bargaining chip for Russia to wage when needed. After the Russo-Georgian war had gone underway, the American President made it his goal to give NATO its next purpose. Hardened by his experience fighting in the Vietnam War, Wesley Clark became a preacher of the Second Cold War, which had begun. At a NATO summit in Brussels, Clark brought up the famed Nord Stream pipeline that was near completion and labeled it a "geopolitical weapon," not a pipeline. So when the pipeline exploded last month, it was only natural for the country labeling Putin as the "Russian menace" to come under suspicion.</p><p><b>Suspect #2:</b> The Russians</p><p>It's no secret that after Wesley Clark's victory in the 2004 United States presidential election, Putin had prepared to deal with a hostile Western Hemisphere. General Clark was famed for his career saving Kosovo from the vilified Serbians, a close brother nation to Russia. It is well known that Clark nearly brought the conflict to a worldwide affair by ordering troops to engage Russian troops at Pristina Airport, and if not for insubordination in his ranks, none of us would be here right now. From the first moment Clark took his seat in the Oval Office, he made wariness of the threat posed by Russia a headline at every opportunity. So Putin might have chosen to pull the plug on this project, given the strange unity between NATO nations.</p><p><b>Suspect #3: </b>Al-Qaeda</p><p>Still reeling from the death of their ring leader, Osama Bin Laden, the terrorist organization has been a key suspect floated by both the United States and Russia as the culprit. Given the tension between the two countries, many suspect the terrorists behind 9/11 were hoping to reignite it to get the two powers to throw their weight at each other. Al-Qaeda has hopes to shake attention from both the United States in Iraq and Russia's interest in Syria. It's not impossible to imagine that they'd go to these lengths to achieve those ends.</p><p>We will likely not know who was behind this bombing until investigations by both Germany and Russia conclude, but nobody is above suspicion.</p><br><span style="color:blue;"><u>What the Clark Administration "Better no gas than a chokehold" memo implies</span></u> (Jan 11th 2011)<br><span style="color:blue;"><u>Second Cold War or another round of cheating puffing?</span></u> (Jan 22nd 2011)<br><span style="color:blue;"><u>Senator Jeff Sessions leads the pack of wolves in the Senate, hoping to reel in Clark's Cold War 2 rhetoric</span></u> (Jan 21st 2011)</p>`)

<p>By <b>[Lisa Fargo]</b></p><p><b>May 23, 2011</b></p><p><b>TRIPOLI—</b>The international scene has recently erupted due to Libyan Dictator Muammar Gaddafi's claims of donating money to influence various Western elections, spurring a political upheaval in those countries. The most damning claims were made against U.S. President Wesley Clark and French President Nicholas Sarkozy, whom Gaddafi stated to have donated money toward their respective elections in 2008 and 2007. As both leaders attempt to fight the fires brought about by these claims, Gaddafi continues to fight for the soul of his nation, with the ongoing Libyan Revolution threatening his position.</p><p>Are his claims valid? No one can say for sure now, but opposition leaders in France and the United States have come forward demanding an investigation. President Clark, whose turbulent 2008 reelection bid victory had been attributed to his leadership in dealing with the economic crisis, is now under speculation for foreign influence. Clark, who made a point that the situation in Libya needs to be handled delicately, faces allegations that he's too close to Gaddafi. The election interference claims now serve to further muddy the waters he treads, but there is no concrete evidence to say that the Clark campaign used or received any funds from Libya. Congressional Republican leaders have called to open an impeachment inquiry to "collect the facts properly," but Democrats remain at the President's defense.</p><p>Sarkozy, however, faces a much greater challenge as the 2012 French presidential election looms over his mandate like a storm. The claims that he took funds from Libya hold more weight with the opposition since, following his 2007 victory, he pursued a policy of detente with Libya. The recent reversal of Sarkozy's Libya policy has put the President under fire for "trying to save face" and avoid an investigation.</p><p>Since 2007, both the United States and France have sought to deepen ties with both leaders, hoping to undo the frosty relations of the early 2000s, but this scandal serves to uproot such progress. The socialist opposition in France has repeatedly attacked President Clark as a divisive force on the national stage. Their qualms lie in the President's policy in dealing with conflicts like the Russo-Georgian war and the declining relations between Ukraine and Russia. If Sarkozy were to be ousted, President Clark's united NATO dream could be soiled by a socialist fire breather taking the reins in France. </p><p>For now, the world watches as two presidents attempt to cleanse the aroma of controversy without losing the mandate they rule by.</p>`)

This came in stark contrast to former Senator Rick Santorum's response, who disavowed the decision and reiterated his support for traditional marriage.</p><p>With polls showing a majority of Americans supporting the decision, it was expected the Republican nominee would focus more on the economy.

Senator Santorum had called for the corporation's disbandment throughout the campaign and reiterated his intentions to disband it upon assuming office.</p><p>When the moderator asked the Vice President's view of the corporation, she stated, "I would continue the Corporation's operations so every American can benefit from mortgage bailouts like the one the former Senator took on his 2 million dollar mansion." The remark drew loud applause, and as polls show, Landrieu won the debate by similar margins that she has led Santorum across this campaign.</p>`)

<p>Nothing surpasses my sheer disappointment more than seeing Republican primary returns nowadays. Every day I'm forced to hear Republicans shout, "THIS IS THE GUY WHO CAN DEFEAT MARY LANDRIEU!" Yes, I'm guilty of it just as much as anyone else, but seriously, Floridians chose to back Mayor Michael Bloomberg? I'm tired of hearing this because NO, this is not the best man suited to close the chapter on Democratic dominance, and I'm not willing to play into delusions.</p><p>And so the benchwarmer candidates are beginning to peel away from their runs for president, hoping to either secure the moderate banner of the Republican Party with Bloomberg or hitch a last-ditch effort to stop him by backing Michelle Bachmann's Bible backed bid. Huntsman, Perry, and Paul are looking more flimsy by the day, so it's only a matter of time until they cash out.</p><p>Here's where all the fan boys of fat fuck Haley Barbour will come in, saying he's gonna surge in the polls. Holy hell, he came in fourth in Iowa. He's undoubtedly the answer America is looking for! I don't give a damn about loser candidates. Last time I checked, there was no bronze medal given out for coming in fourth place. Let's not hype up clowns like this.</p><p>Begrudgingly, I'm beginning to accept that independent minds like mine are never going to get our voices heard in politics. I'm sure as hell not going to back bat shit crazy Bachmann and her "blessed by the lord" run for president. I'm all for a woman running for president, but damn crazy like that lady might just make me vote for Landrieu instead.</p><p>Well, here we are at our only "viable" choice left on the table. Michael Bloomberg. If you forced me to describe my feelings for his candidacy in just a few sentences, I'd come to you with this.</p><p><b>● Bloomberg is nearly a Democrat in Republican clothing; he and Vice President Mary Landrieu widely agree on most issues, and where they differ is on issues like the environment or immigration, where more often than not, the Democrats sound more conservative!</b></p><p><b>● His candidacy is sitting ducks when it comes to trade and confronting China. While the Clark administration has taken a very confrontational position on China's growing economic problems, Bloomberg is screaming the need for "detente." If Landrieu were to push him on this during the general election, she'd stomp him like a BUG.</b></p><p><b>● His response to Clark's "New York Money Men" gaffe essentially cemented his candidacy as a front-running man able to combat the administration's reluctance to stand by Israel, briefly garnering the applause of folks like Mike Huckabee.</b></p><p><b>● Maybe… MAYBE you can convince at least five people in the Deep South that he's a true conservative. Just maybe five people who sleep under a rock can be fooled into thinking that the New Yorker really speaks for their social conservative cause.</b></p><p><b>● Hear me out, but maybe a Republican can win out in the urban centers, I'd surely be interested in seeing that map.</b></p><p>As always, I've reserved my admiration for any candidates once they prove themselves on the national stage. Who knows, maybe Mike is the man able to take the GOP out of its perpetual state of comatose, or he'll sink them again just for Karl Rove to rant and rave about how the numbers coming out of Bowling Green, Kentucky, or Nashville, Tennessee, are incorrect and that the voting machines have got it wrong!</p><p>I have very little faith that President Bloomberg is a real possibility, and unlike Michele Bachmann's fans, I'm not willing to blindly follow what my gut tells me.</p>`)

<p><b>By Matt Shuham</b></p><p><b>October 24, 2012, 4:13 p.m.</b></p><p><b>Start your day with TPM.</b></p><p><b>Sign up for the Morning Memo newsletter.</b></p><p>Conservative shock jock Rush Limbaugh warned Cain supporters not to assume polls showing the GOP nominee losing was "rigged," offering insight to Cain supporters frustrated by the Republican candidates' poor polling against Vice President Landrieu.</p><p>"I wish that I could sit here and tell you that I, without question, think the polls are rigged. I have thought so in previous elections," Limbaugh said Monday on his radio show.</p><p>Limbaugh admitted that he made a similar mistake in underestimating the support of Wesley Clark 4 years ago.</p><p>"In 2008, honest to God, folks, I thought Wes was gonna lose by ten or fifteen. There weren't any polls that said that. I thought they were all using an incorrect turnout sample," Limbaugh said. "The way I was looking at it was that because the economy went belly up voters would naturally see our solutions as more viable. Turns out they never did and Clark was able to prove himself."</p><p>What skews expectations this time around is the controversy surrounding Cain while still holding a tight grip over the Republican base. By contrast, Landrieu, who remains in a comfortable position in the polls, faces problems such as a lack of enthusiasm, making people wonder if the turnout is set to drop this year. "If that's the case this year," the Los Angeles Times' David Lauter wrote in August, "then acknowledging Republican turnout advantage against Democrats would probably boost Cain's standing by a point or two."</p><p>Republican Herman Cain sports the Tea Party credentials, hoping to lead the movement to an explosive victory like the rapid congressional gains made by Republicans in the 2010 midterms. Landrieu has stuck by her credentials in bipartisanship and a continuation of the recovering economy credited to the administration's handling of the recession.</p><p>In 2008, as the campaign season hit its final stretch, Limbaugh often told his supporters that polls were biased toward Clark.</p><p>"They are designed to do exactly what I have warned you to be vigilant about, and that is to depress you and suppress your vote," Limbaugh said in late October 2008 when commenting on a CBS/New York Times poll and a Washington Post poll which slightly favored the president. "These two polls today are designed to convince everybody this election is over."</p><p>Today, though, as the 2012 election is well underway, Limbaugh confesses his doubts and offers sage advice for Cain supporters to remain vigilant. "It's a risk here to just throw the polls out and say they don't matter because you end up creating a false reality for yourself that isn't true."</p><p><b>Start your day with TPM.</b></p><p><b>Sign up for the Morning Memo newsletter.</b></p>`)

<p><b>Al Harrison || ABC Editor</b></p><p><b>July 1st 2012</b></p><p>As part of an attack on the Clark Administration's vaccine policies, particularly regarding the sexually transmitted disease HPV, which can lead to cervical cancer, the Republican nominee for President, <b>Michele Bachmann</b>, claimed that a woman told her after a Republican debate that the HPV vaccine had caused her daughter to develop <b>"mental retardation"</b>.</p><p>The attack is based on the longstanding myths of vaccines causing learning deficiencies. The "gaffe" was followed by multiple public opinion polls showing Bachmann's support had severely dropped as the post-convention excitement had seemingly vanished for the Congresswoman.</p><p>Vice President Landrieu's early ad campaign also helped beat down Bachmann's polling, revealing much of his radical and sometimes cruel policies related to bullying and her stance on cutting social security. This gaffe has accumulated the distrust of families across the nation, unsettled by Bachmann's blatant disregard for public health safety.</p><p>Likewise, independent voters have begun to break for the Landrieu campaign in even greater numbers, with polls showing the Vice president leading Bachmann by 15-20 points with independent voters. A disappointing sight for Republicans to witness as the Republican National Convention displayed possibly the highest amount of excitement ever before seen for a single candidate.</p><p>Assuming Bachmann can't gain ground with independents, it's unlikely she'll be able to offset those losses by breaking into much of the industrial Midwest since Vice President Landrieu's running mate, <b>Sherrod Brown</b>, has seemingly locked down blue-collar voters.</p>`)

<p><b>By Rochelle Williams </b></p><p><b>Madison, Wisconsin — </b>Among a primary filled with partisan grievances, political theater, and rhetoric stood the popular former Utah Governor, Jon Huntsman. The Democratic Party's nightmare was not an evangelical loon ready to ring the bells of social issues or even a Tea Party Huckster declaring war on government spending. The nuclear option was always Governor Huntsman, the moderate heartthrob. </p><p>The well-spoken Governor with a record without blemish, he exited the Republican convention with a decisive lead in most polls. Huntsman had honed in on the sluggish economy, vowing to bring economic opportunity back while slashing taxes for the lower and middle class. Democrats hoped the Governor's positions on social issues and immigration would generate criticism from his right flank, but their hopes fizzled as the GOP, driven by anti-Democrat hunger, rallied behind him anyway.</p><p>But the gloves came off when the conversation trailed off to China.</p><p>One of President Clark's late-term initiatives has been reinforcing American economic interests from the supposed "threat" China poses to American interests both at home and abroad. Democrats have begun to push emphasis on Huntsman's ties to the Huntsman Corporation, with some even labeling Huntsman "the candidate who will sell your jobs to China." Huntsman has pushed back on these claims, proclaiming he has no current ties to the corporation and would work to create new jobs for America's industrial heartland. </p><p>Vice President Landrieu has also taken this rhetoric in her attacks on Huntsman, hoping to claw her way up from the political quicksand that is the economy. However, some of Clark's initiatives to combat China have garnered criticism, like the advocacy for a Trans Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade agreement between 12 Pacific Rim economies: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States. The proposal has hit the natural Democratic base of unions, unwilling to accept another free trade agreement without basic assurances that their jobs won't be affected. </p><p>The deal that President Clark has begun negotiations for presents a challenge to his Vice President's campaign, which has so far failed to reconnect with disillusioned workers and distance itself from unpopular trade policies. </p><p>The time for Landrieu to change course is fading rapidly, and her chances of carrying the Democratic torch another four years may just go up in smoke.</p>`)
