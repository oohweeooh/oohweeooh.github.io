Bobby knew Roosevelt was looking down with pride at the future of liberalism - with the Democratic majority in the Houses and the Senate, coupled with such a commanding victory over Nixon, the fight against poverty Eisenhower neglected can be reignited with renewed vigor.</p><p>Bobby was surprised with a hug from a grinning Jack. The men burst into smiles, and they talked briefly about the future they had created, each saying the other was more responsible. After a few minutes, Jack left to deliver his acceptance speech. Bobby smirks, looking forward to reading Nixon’s concession speech. </p><p>Bobby breathes in the atmosphere he created. <i>He</i> did this.He had a great candidate and a lot of resources, but he was the strategist. He deserved recognition. He looked for Dad, and found him grinning and shaking hands. Marching up with a nervous smile, he asked how he did.</p><p>Dad stopped grinning, and glared at him. Bobby felt like he was 8 years old again - a loser in a house of winners. “You did your job, Robert. John was good on TV and I had enough money to keep him there. You didn’t make any errors.” Bobby nodded, and left the celebration for some air, and let Jack enjoy his victory.</p>"
